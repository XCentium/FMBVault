When you first access Mobile Banking, you will have to answer one of your existing MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) questions. At this time, a "cookie" is stored on your mobile phone's browser, which allows the Mobile Banking system to remember you have accessed it before. The cookie is only visible by the Mobile Banking system and does not contain your personal information. Some mobile phones may require you to enable cookies or periodically erase them, requiring the MFA question to appear again. If you are experiencing this issue, check your phone settings to ensure that cookies are enabled. If cookies are enabled and the issue persists, please contact your wireless carrier for cookie support information on your mobile phone.
