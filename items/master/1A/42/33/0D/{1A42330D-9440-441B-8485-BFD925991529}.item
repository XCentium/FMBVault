<p class="subtitle">Jeff Frieden, F&amp;M Bank client since 1990</p>
<p>Jeff Frieden will never forget the day when Ken Walker, then F&amp;M President, gave him his first line of credit for $1 million in 1990.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had explored working with other banks, and I remember meeting with Ken who understood my business within 15 minutes,&rdquo; said Frieden, whose business at the time, landauction.com, served as a precursor to Auction.com, now the nation&rsquo;s leading online real estate marketplace, where Jeff is currently CEO. &ldquo;Even when market conditions were tough, F&amp;M continued to work with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like business partner Robert Friedman, Frieden&rsquo;s relationship with F&amp;M now extends far beyond his initial line of credit. His father was an F&amp;M customer in the 1960s, and his 93-year-old mother is still a customer to this day. &ldquo;Everyone knows my mom when she walks into the bank, and that means a lot to me, and to her,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Frieden also values F&amp;M&rsquo;s conservative approach to banking, which resonates with him as a shareholder of F&amp;M and father of 7- and 8-year-old children whom have opened up Youth Savings accounts at the Bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The personalized service, transparency and overall philosophy make F&amp;M an ideal fit for me, and it feels good to pass along the tradition of banking with F&amp;M to my children,&rdquo; Frieden said.</p>

<p>Robert Friedman recalls when he and his business partner, Jeff Frieden, were young entrepreneurs in search of a banking partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were 25 years old, and F&amp;M was there for us as a foundational partner for all of our businesses,&rdquo; said Friedman, who today is chairman and co-founder of Auction. com, which has sold more than $30 billion in residential and commercial assets since 2007. &ldquo;We have a good, honest relationship with F&amp;M, and those are the types of relationships that make it easier to scale a business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The relationship between F&amp;M and Friedman extends beyond just business. Friedman, a longtime board member of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Orange County, encouraged F&amp;M President Henry Walker to get involved with the organization more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry has been a significant contributor to the organization ever since, which is a testament to how our core values truly align with each other,&rdquo; said Friedman, noting that Walker received the organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;Man of the Year&rdquo; award in 2009. &ldquo;There is a lot of mutual respect between us, and that stems from the desire to help members of our community to become good citizens.&rdquo;</p>
