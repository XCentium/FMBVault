Successfully submitting your check image with your mobile device will begin the deposit process. The processing time to complete the deposit varies. The cut-off time for deposits made through Mobile Check Deposit is 6:00 pm PST. If you make a deposit before the cut-off time on a business day, we will consider that day to be the date of deposit. Business days are Monday through Friday with the exception of federal holidays. Deposits made at any other time will be considered deposits made on the next business day. If your deposit is declined for any reason (e.g. the check was previously deposited), you will not see it post to your account. There is no notification if the deposit is declined. You must view your Deposit History to see the status of your deposit. Deposits may be subject to additional case by case or exception holds.
