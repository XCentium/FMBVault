<h2>Online Privacy Statement.</h2>
<p>
Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank of Long Beach (&ldquo;F&amp;M Bank&rdquo;) values and protects your privacy.  We thank you for the trust that you place in us and we want you to know that the information you share with us will be treated with care.   Throughout this Statement we refer to &ldquo;nonpublic personal information&rdquo;, which includes a) information you provide to us to obtain a financial product or service; b) information resulting from any transaction involving a financial product or service between you and us; or c) information we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service to you.<br>
<br>
<strong>Visitors to Our Web Site.</strong> Visitors to our web site remain anonymous, unless they register for a service or otherwise elect to disclose their identity to us.  Although we do not collect personally identifying information about persons who simply visit our site, we do collect certain limited information about visitors, such as their IP address (a numeric address assigned automatically to computers when they access the Internet).  We also may place &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; on a computer to track a visitor's use of our web site.  A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your hard drive.  It takes up very little room on your system and helps us to customize our site and make its navigation easier for you. We sometimes use cookies to help estimate the number of visitors to our site and to determine which areas are the most popular. Unless you register with us for a service (such as opening an F&amp;M Bank account online), the cookie does not provide us with any personally identifying information about you, such as your name or address.</p>
<p>We use Google tracking, Google Advertising and BING Advertising products to improve our advertising efforts, including, but not limited to: Remarketing with Google Adwords, Remarketing with BING, Google Analytics, and Google Display Network. Google and BING use cookies to display F&amp;M Bank ads based on our visitors' past visits to the F&amp;M Bank website, other websites and their activity on Google.com and BING. You may find out more about <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank" title="Google Advertising Policies">Google Advertising Policies</a> or use their <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" title="free opt-out tool">free opt-out tool</a>.

<p>Information about Online Tracking.  Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked.  Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a single website.  For these purposes tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time.  How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform.  As a result, this site is not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser.  Even so, as described more fully throughout this Online Privacy Statement, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.  For a description of Do Not Track protocols for browsers and mobile devices, or simply to learn more about the choices available to you, you can visit the All About Do Not Track website: <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com" title="http://allaboutdnt.com">http://allaboutdnt.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Our Collection and Use of Information</strong>. We may collect nonpublic personal information about you in order to understand your needs, to administer our business, to process transactions, and to provide you with products and services. We obtain nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Information we receive from you on applications or other forms (such as name, street address, e-mail address, phone number, social security number, date of birth, assets, income and beneficiaries)</li>
    <li>Information about your transactions with us, or others (such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transactions, and credit usage)</li>
    <li>Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency (such as your creditworthiness and credit history)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not disclose nonpublic personal information about our current or former customers to parties not affiliated with F&amp;M Bank except as set forth in this notice or as permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>Security of Nonpublic Personal Information</strong>.  We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those F&amp;M Bank employees who need to know such information (i.e., to process your transactions or provide services to you.)  We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. <br>
<br>
<strong>Maintaining Accurate Information</strong>.  We have procedures that help us to maintain the accuracy of the personally identifiable information that we collect.  <br>
<br>
