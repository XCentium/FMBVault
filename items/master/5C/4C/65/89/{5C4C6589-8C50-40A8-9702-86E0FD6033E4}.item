<p>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank (F&amp;M), one of the strongest commercial and retail banks in California for over 100 years, announced the Grand Re-Opening of its Rolling Hills Estates Office following a branch transformation project.</p>
<p>Throughout the facility, clients will now find a redesigned teller line, a new location for the front door, and most notably, an open layout. The placement of the new entrance offers clients immediate contact with the banking staff, while the new design streamlines banking services, allowing clients to open accounts or make deposits all with the same teller. The Rolling Hills Estates Office maintained the ATM location for those clients who need service outside of traditional banking hours.</p>
<p>Beyond the remodel of the building&rsquo;s appearance, the branch has also upgraded its technology. New digital signage offers product recommendations and F&amp;M History facts. Upgrades to the mobile app provide access to remote bill pay functions and internal transfers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This branch transformation project has enhanced the appearance of the facility and increased the information available to all staff members, empowering them as a workforce to benefit the clients,&rdquo; said Roy Almeida, Vice President and Branch Manager of Rolling Hills Estates. &ldquo;Customer experience is of the upmost importance at Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank and our new open environment allows employees to be more conducive to responding to our clients' needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The completion of the Rolling Hills Estates renovation marks the first of a series of ventures F&amp;M has planned to expand its presence in the South Bay. The bank has already scheduled to break ground on a new Redondo Beach Office later this year and hopes to implement the open layout in other offices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rolling Hills Estates location has a dedicated staff of on-site decision makers to help provide our clients with a trusted brand of handshake service that is consistent from branch-to-branch,&rdquo; said Daniel Walker, Chairman of the Board and CEO of F&amp;M. &ldquo;South Bay residents can expect the same level of expert service, customizable solutions, and strong values, that have been in place at Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank for over one hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clients can enjoy breakfast and take tours of the newly renovated office at the Grand Re-Opening Open House on Wednesday, June 8, 2016.
