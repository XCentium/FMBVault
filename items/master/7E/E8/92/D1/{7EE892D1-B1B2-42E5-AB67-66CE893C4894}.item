<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333;">The APY is the Annual Percentage Yield. It&rsquo;s the interest rate you would earn if the money stayed on deposit for 365 days and it takes into consideration compounding interest. The interest rate is the daily rate you would earn without compounding.</span>
