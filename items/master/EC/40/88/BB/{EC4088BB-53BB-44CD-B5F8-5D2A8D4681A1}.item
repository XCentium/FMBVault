Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank credit and debit cards have an embedded chip that adds an extra layer of security to your transactions. Chip technology is the global standard in fraud protection giving you even more protection against fraud and theft. Your account information is stored on the small metal chip on the front of your card. The chip generates a dynamic code for another layer of security, making every transaction unique. Chip technology makes it more difficult for criminals to counterfeit your card.
