<p>Friends,
</p>
<p>
<img height="260" alt="Phil Bond" width="220" src="-/media/A41D711A40AC4A8E9EE8ABD171C5D5DC.ashx" style="float: right;">Staying true to commitments, allowing others to rely and build trust in you - that's Dependability. It's what Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank founder, C.J. Walker instilled in our organization 108 years ago, when he calmed a crowd of anxious clients that had fled to the bank scared that their money was unsafe because of the unstable 1907 stock market. Standing atop the teller line, C.J. waited for the lobby to be filled before introducing himself and assuring all that not only was their money safe, but if they chose, the bank would fully refund their deposits in gold. In that very moment, C.J. instilled Dependability as a core value in F&amp;M Bank forevermore.
</p>
<p>You see, Dependability is tested most in extreme cycles. Just like in 1907, and during the most recent financial crisis, F&amp;M showed that even during tough economic conditions we remain focused on what is best for our clients. We stayed true to our conservative values by focusing on sound business decisions. And by not overextending the bank's capital or investing in sub-prime loans, we were able to provide uninterrupted service for our clients. By sticking to our core values, we were able to demonstrate our Dependability, and create a safe place for our clients. Again, allowing them to rely and build a trust in us knowing that their hard earned money was secure with F&amp;M.
</p>
<p>
As F&amp;M Bank continues to grow, we will remain focused on the best interests of our clients. Even with the development and implementation of new technologies, we will always remember that banking is a people business. When a client walks in our doors, we want to get to know their specific story, and find a solution for their unique needs. We want to ensure that, no matter what the future holds, our clients feel secure banking with F&amp;M, and trust that they have a partner to depend on.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,</p>
