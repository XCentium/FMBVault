<p>Please refer to Services and Fees on <a href="-/media/453BFF11F80148FCB802EAB20F6DD733.ashx">fmb.com/fees</a> for additional account details. Terms and Conditions may apply.
</p>
<p>Rates may change at any time without prior notice, before or after the account is opened. Fees could reduce earnings on the account.
</p>
<p>Deposit Accounts: Interest for checking and money market accounts are compounded and credited to your account monthly on the monthly statement cycled date. Interest for savings accounts are
compounded and credited to your account quarterly on the quarterly statement cycle date. If you close your account before interest is credited, you will not receive the accrued interest.
</p>
<p>CD Accounts: APY assumes that interest is compounded and credited monthly and remains on deposit until maturity. Interest rates are fixed rates and are paid for the term of the deposit until
maturity. A withdrawal of interest prior to maturity will reduce earnings. A penalty will be imposed for early withdrawal.
</p>
<p>IRA Accounts: APY assumes that interest is compounded and credited quarterly and remains on deposit until maturity. Interest rates are fixed rates and are paid for the term of the deposit until
maturity. Deposits may be made to your account in accordance with your IRA plan disclosure. A withdrawal of interest prior to maturity will reduce earnings. A penalty will be imposed for early
withdrawal.
