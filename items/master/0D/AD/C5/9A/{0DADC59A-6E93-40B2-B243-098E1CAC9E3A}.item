Replacing your magnetic stripe card with a new chip card is one way F&amp;M can secure your purchases and transactions when you're traveling both in the United States and internationally. As a security measure, your old card will be deactivated soon after you receive your new chip card. Confirm you have received your new chip card by following the directions on your new card letter to activate.
