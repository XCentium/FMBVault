The Tradition of an Enormous Christmas Tree in the Lobby Dates Back Over 100 Years

<p>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank (F&amp;M) clients and employees looked on as a large Noble Fir Christmas tree was carried into the Bank, muscled over the teller cages and raised in the center of the banking floor by members of Kaplan Construction and the Long Beach State Rugby Team.  The Bank office at 3rd Street and Pine Avenue was abuzz as the 13 foot tree was delivered and erected in the middle of the banking floor action.</p>
<p>With safety in mind, Kaplan Construction assembled scaffolding on both sides of the teller cages to aid in the hoisting of the giant tree over the side.  Once the tree was lifted over, it was carried to the center of the banking floor and raised onto a platform where it will be decorated and displayed through the Christmas season.</p>
<p>The exciting tradition of a Christmas tree in the lobby dates back to F&amp;M Founder C.J. Walker&rsquo;s days as president.  Each year, he had an enormous Douglas Fir carried into the bank, muscled over the teller cages and raised in the corner of the banking floor.  To decorate the huge tree, a makeshift scaffold of two ladders and a board plank was rigged so the tree could be crowned with a star and decorated from the top down by F&amp;M executives and employees.  The lower portions of the tree were reserved for the children of employees, who were allowed in after hours with their parents to finish the decorating.</p>
<p>In addition to the annual Christmas tree delivery, F&amp;M also participates in local toy drives and serves warm Wassail and Gingerbread to all clients that visit the Bank&rsquo;s 24 Southern California branches between December 19th and 24th.</p>
<p>As a gesture of thanks to the Long Beach State Rugby Team for their assistance, F&amp;M Bank donated $1,000 to support their program.  </p>
