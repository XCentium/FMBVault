Online Banking requires a Business or Personal account with F&amp;M Bank. A separate application and agreement are required for Online Banking, Cash Management, and Bill Pay services. Transfers between accounts will be processed immediately if requested by 6pm. All other transactions initiated between the hours of 3:00 PM and 12:00 AM PST on weekends or holidays will be processed the next business day. Other transaction limitations or account fees may apply. Refer to the account agreements for details.
