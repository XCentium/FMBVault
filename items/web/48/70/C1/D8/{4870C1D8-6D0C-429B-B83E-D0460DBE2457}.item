<p>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank (F&amp;M Bank) announced today its continuing commitment to the Long Beach community through their monetary support for Camp Fire USA Greater Long Beach&rsquo;s urban forest upgrade.</p>
<p>The five acre day camp&rsquo;s Urban Forest redevelopment project includes upgrades such as a &frac34; mile discovery trail through the property, mature trees and other native plants added, and an extension of pipes to allow a new irrigation system that uses recycled water instead of precious potable water. Camp Fire&rsquo;s Executive Director, Shirlee Jackert said &ldquo;the fresh smell of the new trees and shrubs at the camp really elevate the overall nature experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the current phase of the project complete, Camp Fire celebrated with a ribbon cutting event last Saturday at 2:00pm at Camp Fire&rsquo;s Camp Shiwaka at 7070 East Carson Street, Long Beach, CA 90808.</p>
<p>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank, along with other contributors, has been a supporter of the redevelopment project since its inception in 2013.</p>
