No, you can only use your new chip card. After activating your new chip card, please destroy your old card immediately. Your new chip card still has a magnetic stripe on the back, so that you can use it at merchants who do not accept chip cards yet. There are no changes to how you purchase online and over the phone. Your old card will expire soon after you receive your new chip card.
