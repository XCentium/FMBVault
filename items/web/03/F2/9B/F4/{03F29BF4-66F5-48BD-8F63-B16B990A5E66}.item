<p>F&amp;M&rsquo;s Bixby Knolls office, at 4545 California Avenue in Long Beach, played host to Mr. Funk&rsquo;s 100th birthday celebration on Thursday afternoon. F&amp;M employees, clients and family of Mr. Funk all attended the festivities. He was celebrated with a cake, balloons, a special letter of thanks from F&amp;M Executives and a &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; song from the crowd.</p>
<p>Phil L. Sblendorio, Senior Vice President and Regional Manager at F&amp;M Bank said &ldquo;We always look up to Mr. Funk, he&rsquo;s like a family member.&rdquo;</p>
