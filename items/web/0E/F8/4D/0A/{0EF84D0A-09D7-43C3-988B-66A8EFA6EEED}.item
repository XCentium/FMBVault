F&amp;M Bank uses various strategies driven by current fraud trends. We examine many variables (i.e. the dollar amount, the rate of transaction, and the merchant type and location, etc.) to determine if a transaction is suspicious and potentially fraudulent. We also monitor prior account usage patterns, like geographical locations consistent with your other account transactions. In some cases, the characteristics of multiple transactions may raise suspicion and you may receive Fraud Alerts for more than one transaction. When the Fraud Alert is sent, we will ask you to respond to confirm if the transaction is yours or not.
