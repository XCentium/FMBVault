<p>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank (F&amp;M Bank) celebrated the 100th birthday of Mary Ann Mulloy, a valued client for nearly 60 years.</p>
<p>F&amp;M&rsquo;s Main office in Downtown Long Beach, at 302 Pine Avenue, hosted Ms. Mulloy&rsquo;s 100th birthday celebration on Tuesday. F&amp;M employees, Executives and friends of Ms. Mulloy all attended the festivities. Mary was celebrated with a cake, balloons, a special letter of thanks from F&amp;M Executives and a &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; song from the crowd.</p>
<p>F&amp;M President, W. Henry Walker said &ldquo;Clients like Mary are the reason we get up in the morning and come here to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked about her secret to long life, Ms. Mulloy attributes her longevity to &ldquo;the good Lord and a healthy lifestyle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Mulloy was born in western Nebraska and grew up to pursue a lifetime of teaching that began in 1934 in a Nebraska one-room school house. She moved to California in 1938, where she completed her college education with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara (1941) and a Master of Arts degree from California State University, Long Beach (1957), in preparation for teaching in public schools. She taught first grade in Visalia before coming to Southern California. Upon her graduation from Bible Institute of Los Angeles in 1947, she was invited to teach 1st/2nd grade at the new Brethren Christian School being started that year.</p>
<p>In 1964 when the local church she attended was destroyed in a fire, Ms. Mulloy, in service to God and her country, graciously opened her home for 10 years to host Saturday night Bible study meetings for Military servicemen. She faithfully taught Sunday School classes for 40 years.</p>
<p>Ms. Mulloy continues to remain active since her retirement in 1977. She manages six apartments on a property in which she serves as trustee, is an inspiration and blessing to all who know her, and a faithful member of Cornerstone Church.</p>
<p>If she can&rsquo;t be reached at home you might try calling her cell phone; and if she&rsquo;s driving, leave your number and she&rsquo;ll get back to you!</p>
<p>Mary Mulloy&rsquo;s 100th birthday is on November 20th. She has been a client at Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank since 1956.</p>
